# DevOps Git Project

This project demonstrates Git best practices in a DevOps workflow. It includes version control management, proper branching strategies, pull requests, tagging, and markdown documentation.

## 📌 Project Structure

- **main**: Stable production-ready code.
- **dev**: Development integration branch.
- **feature/**: Feature branches for isolated development tasks.

## 🔀 Git Workflow

1. Develop features in `feature/*` branches.
2. Merge to `dev` via Pull Request (PR).
3. After testing, merge `dev` to `main` via PR.
4. Tag main releases using `git tag`.
